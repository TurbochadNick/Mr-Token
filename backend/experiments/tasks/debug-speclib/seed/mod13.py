"""mod13 - single-function module.

    BEHAVIOR REFERENCE - module 'mod13' (function `rollhash`)
    AUTHORITATIVE. The function body below is buggy; correct it to match THIS
    specification exactly. The test asserts a one-way digest of the outputs over a
    fixed domain, so the expected outputs appear NOWHERE in the test file - this
    reference is the ONLY source of the concrete behavior. Read it fully before editing.
    
    Signature: rollhash(s)
    Constants for THIS module: P, M = 37, 1013
    
    Specification:
        Polynomial rolling hash of the string s modulo 1013.
        Algorithm: h = (sum over positions i of ord(s[i]) * P**i) % M, where the exponent
        is the 0-based index i (the first char uses P**0). P = 37, M = 1013.
        Empty string hashes to 0.
