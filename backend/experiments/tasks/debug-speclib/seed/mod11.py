"""mod11 - single-function module.

    BEHAVIOR REFERENCE - module 'mod11' (function `poly`)
    AUTHORITATIVE. The function body below is buggy; correct it to match THIS
    specification exactly. The test asserts a one-way digest of the outputs over a
    fixed domain, so the expected outputs appear NOWHERE in the test file - this
    reference is the ONLY source of the concrete behavior. Read it fully before editing.
    
    Signature: poly(n)
    Constants for THIS module: C, D, M = 3, 5, 101
    
    Specification:
        Evaluate a cubic polynomial modulo 101.
        Algorithm: return (n**3 + C*n + D) % M with C = 3, D = 5, M = 101.
        The leading term is n CUBED (n*n*n), not squared.
