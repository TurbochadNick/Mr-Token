"""mod15 - single-function module.

    BEHAVIOR REFERENCE - module 'mod15' (function `checksum`)
    AUTHORITATIVE. The function body below is buggy; correct it to match THIS
    specification exactly. The test asserts a one-way digest of the outputs over a
    fixed domain, so the expected outputs appear NOWHERE in the test file - this
    reference is the ONLY source of the concrete behavior. Read it fully before editing.
    
    Signature: checksum(n)
    Constants for THIS module: W1, W2, M = 7, 3, 101
    
    Specification:
        Weighted digit checksum of n modulo 101.
        Algorithm: read the base-10 digits of n from the RIGHT. Weight the rightmost digit
        by W1 = 7, the next by W2 = 3, then W1, W2, ... alternating. Sum weight*digit,
        then take % M with M = 101. checksum(0) is 0.

    satisfy over one input band; the property test samples across all bands):
