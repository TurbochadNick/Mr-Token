"""mod01 - single-function module.

    BEHAVIOR REFERENCE - module 'mod01' (function `digit_sum`)
    AUTHORITATIVE. The function body below is buggy; correct it to match THIS
    specification exactly. The test asserts a one-way digest of the outputs over a
    fixed domain, so the expected outputs appear NOWHERE in the test file - this
    reference is the ONLY source of the concrete behavior. Read it fully before editing.
    
    Signature: digit_sum(n)
    Constants for THIS module: b = 3
    
    Specification:
        Sum the digits of n written in base 3 (NOT base 10).
        Algorithm: repeatedly add (t % 3) and floor-divide t by 3 until t == 0.
        digit_sum(0) is 0. The base is 3.

    satisfy over one input band; the property test samples across all bands):
