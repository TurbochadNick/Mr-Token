"""mod20 - single-function module.

    BEHAVIOR REFERENCE - module 'mod20' (function `bitrev`)
    AUTHORITATIVE. The function body below is buggy; correct it to match THIS
    specification exactly. The test asserts a one-way digest of the outputs over a
    fixed domain, so the expected outputs appear NOWHERE in the test file - this
    reference is the ONLY source of the concrete behavior. Read it fully before editing.
    
    Signature: bitrev(n)
    Constants for THIS module: W = 7
    
    Specification:
        Reverse the low 7 bits of n.
        Algorithm: build r by shifting in bits 0..6 of n from LSB to MSB:
        for i in range(7): r = (r << 1) | ((n >> i) & 1). Bit width W = 7.
        Result is in 0..127.

    satisfy over one input band; the property test samples across all bands):
